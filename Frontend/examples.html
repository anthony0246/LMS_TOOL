        <h1>Chatbot Usage Examples</h1>
        <p>Here are some practical examples of how to interact with the chatbot.</p>

        <h2>Example 1: Sending a Simple Message</h2>
        <p>To send a message, type the following:</p>
        <p> "Hi there, chatbot!";</p>

        <h2>Example 2: Sending a Message with Attachments</h2>
        <p>You can also send attachments using the file selector</p>
        

        <h2>Example 3: Real-Time Interaction and Response Handling</h2>
        <p>Once a user sends a message like, "What are the latest products available?", 
            the chatbot can process the request and instantly respond with personalized recommendations or a list of products. 
            This interaction improves the user experience by offering immediate, relevant information.</p>

        <h2>Use Case 1: Personalized Recommendations</h2>
        <p>Chatbots can offer personalized product or service recommendations based on user preferences. 
            For instance, after a user asks, "Can you suggest a laptop under $1000?", 
            the chatbot would respond with tailored options, like a list of laptops meeting the criteria, complete with links to purchase them.
            This makes shopping or product searching more convenient for the user.</p>
